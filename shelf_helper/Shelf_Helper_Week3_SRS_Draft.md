# Shelf_Helper Week 3 Progress & Documentation Draft

## What has been done So Far

### 1. Getting the Project Up and Running
This week, we focused on making sure the Shelf_Helper project is set up and ready to go. We found all the necessary files for the web app, including the main code, supporting modules, and documentation. We also made sure the app runs smoothly by starting it up and checking that it works in a browser.

### 2. Understanding the Project Structure
Shelf_Helper is built using Flask, which means it’s organized into different pieces—like authentication, database models, and extensions. This structure is great for keeping things tidy and scalable, but it does mean we need clear documentation so everything makes sense as the project grows.

### 3. Tackling the Tricky Parts
Some parts of Shelf_Helper are a bit more complex:
- User authentication and database management are handled with Flask-Login and SQLAlchemy, so we need to be careful with user data and security.
- The app is set up to support multiple languages using Flask-Babel, which is awesome but adds some extra steps for translation and localization.

### 4. Documentation and Next Steps
We found a README file and started this SRS (Software Requirements Specification) draft to explain our progress and outline any tough areas. The project repository is organized and ready for future updates, and this document will be included for submission.

## What’s Next?
Our next steps will be to expand this document as the project develops, especially as we add more features or run into new challenges. For now, this draft covers what we’ve accomplished and highlights the areas that might need extra attention moving forward.
