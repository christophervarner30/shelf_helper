Shelf_Helper Week 3 Progress & Documentation 

1. Getting the Project Up and Running
This week, I focused on making sure the Shelf Helper project is set up and ready to go. I found all the necessary files for the web app, including the main code, supporting modules, and documentation. I also ensured that the app runs smoothly by starting it up and checking that it works in a browser.
2. Understanding the Project Structure
Shelf Helper is built using Flask, which means it is organized into different pieces—like authentication, database models, and extension modules. I took the time to familiarize myself with how these components interact and where they are located within the project directory. This understanding is crucial for making any modifications or additions in the future.
3. Setting Up the Development Environment
I successfully set up my development environment, including installing all necessary dependencies listed in the requirements file. This ensures that I can run the application locally without issues. Additionally, I configured a virtual environment to keep the project’s packages isolated from other projects on my machine.
4. Implementing Basic Features
This week, I started implementing some basic features of the Shelf Helper app. I focused on user authentication, allowing users to register and log in securely. I utilized Flask-Login for managing user sessions and ensured password security by hashing passwords before storing them in the database.
5. Testing Functionality
After implementing the authentication feature, I conducted tests to ensure everything works as expected. I wrote unit tests for the registration and login processes, verifying that users could create accounts and access their profiles without errors. The tests passed successfully, confirming that the functionality is robust.
Next Steps
1. Expanding Features
In the coming weeks, I plan to expand the application’s features further, such as adding functionalities for users to manage their shelves, including adding, editing, and deleting items.
2. Improving Documentation
I will also focus on improving the documentation to make it easier for new developers to understand the codebase and contribute effectively.
3. User Interface Enhancements
Lastly, I aim to enhance the user interface to improve usability and overall user experience, ensuring that the app is not only functional but also visually appealing.
Overall, this week has been productive, laying a solid foundation for the continued development of the Shelf Helper project.
