Shelf Helper - An Accessible Shopping Solution
Capstone Project Presentation

Problem Statement:
Our project addresses a significant accessibility challenge in retail environments. Many elderly or physically limited customers struggle to reach products on high shelves, which can lead to:
• Risk of injury from stretching or climbing
• Dependency on staff availability
• Reduced shopping independence
• Potential loss of sales for stores

Solution Overview:
We've developed a web-based application that modernizes the in-store shopping experience through:

1. Digital Product Selection
   • Customers can browse and select top-shelf items through an intuitive interface
   • Real-time stock availability updates
   • Clear product descriptions and pricing

2. Staff Integration
   • Automated order queue system
   • Clear shelf location indicators for efficient retrieval
   • Order status tracking

Technical Implementation:
The application is built using modern web technologies:

1. Backend:
   • Python Flask framework for robust server-side operations
   • SQLAlchemy for efficient database management
   • RESTful API architecture for seamless communication

2. Frontend:
   • Responsive design using modern HTML5 and CSS3
   • Interactive JavaScript for real-time updates
   • Glass-morphism UI design for enhanced user experience

3. Database:
   • SQLite database for:
     - Product inventory management
     - Order processing
     - Stock tracking

Key Features:

1. Customer Interface:
   Example of our order processing logic:
   ```python
   @app.route('/create_order', methods=['POST'])
   def create_order():
       # Handles real-time order creation and inventory updates
       # Ensures thread-safe stock management
   ```

2. Staff Dashboard:
   ```python
   @app.route('/staff')
   def staff_view():
       # Provides real-time order queue
       # Includes shelf locations for efficient retrieval
   ```

Technical Innovations:
1. Real-time Stock Management
2. Concurrent Order Processing
3. Responsive Design for Various Devices
4. Modern UI/UX Implementation

Business Impact:
This solution:
1. Enhances store accessibility
2. Improves customer satisfaction
3. Reduces liability risks
4. Optimizes staff efficiency
5. Increases sales potential from high-shelf items

Future Enhancements:
1. Mobile App Integration
2. Multiple Store Support
3. Analytics Dashboard
4. Customer Preference Learning
5. Integration with Store Inventory Systems

Development Process:
We followed an agile methodology:
1. Requirements Analysis
2. Iterative Development
3. Continuous Testing
4. User Feedback Integration
5. Performance Optimization

Demo Scenario:
A typical use case demonstration:
1. A customer identifies a desired top-shelf item
2. They use our interface to select the product
3. Staff receives immediate notification
4. Product is retrieved and prepared for pickup
5. Customer collects their item safely at the counter
